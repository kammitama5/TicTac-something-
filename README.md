# TicTac-something-

Trying to understand the logic of things. I intend to do these in a few different languages. 
I've noticed that I spend vast amounts of time learning not just languages, but just doing puzzles/ games. 
I can't really spend a long time working on certain things, but puzzles and algos..bring it.
So I'm guessing that's sort of where I'm headed?
